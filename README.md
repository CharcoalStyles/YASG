# Yet Another Survivors Game

Just a simple survivors type game.

I'm trying to remember how to game dev, HaxeFlixel and OOP ðŸ¤£

## About

I thought a little twin-stick survivors type game might be a really cool first game to dip my toes back into some game dev.

Originally, I was thinking about playing around with a structure where you would have to unlock different directions to walk and shoot form the start. But that felt a little *too much*. So I switched to a SNES style [Smash T.V.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smash_TV) control system; mainly so I can play it with my [8BitDo zero 2[(https://www.8bitdo.com/zero2/).
